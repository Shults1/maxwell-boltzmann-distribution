# maxwell-boltzmann-distribution
It is a small university project, goals of which are to simulate a gas of solid spheres and to get Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution


You can see exaple of simulation at media/uniform_initialization.mp4 
(at the begining there is a spike, because all particals initialized with same velocity)

# maxwell-boltzmann-distribution
It is a small university project, goals of which is to simulate a gas of solid spheres, and to get Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution modeled


You can see exaple of simulation at media/uniform_initialization.mp4 
(at the begining there is a spike, it is because all particals initialized with same velocity)
